The sound sources you are using in this lab must contain complex spectra. You are required to use one of the approaches outlined this week (either Amplitude Modulation, or single-cycle waveforms - see the AKWF.zip file provided with this week's materials). You are also encouraged to utilize additive synthesis examples from last week if you wish.\n\n4. Your controls should be clearly labeled & positioned appropriately: if you designed three independent sounds, please provide three buttons for us to click on while grading.\n\n5. IMPORTANT: use loadbang and loadmess objects to automatically set up the default values in your patches. Do not turn up the master gain~ automatically.",
